# Titanic Survival Prediction

A beginner data science project to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.

## 🎯 Goal
Learn the end-to-end workflow of a data science project:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training (Decision Tree)
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- 891 passengers with features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.
- Target: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate.
- Having a cabin was a strong predictor of survival.
- The model achieved **~81% accuracy**.
